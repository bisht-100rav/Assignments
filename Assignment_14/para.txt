"Atticus said to Jem one day,"I'd rather you shot at tin cans in the backyard,but I know you'll go after birds.
Shoot all the blur jays you want,if you cant hit'em but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."
That was the only timeI ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it.
"Your father's right," she said,."Mockingbirds don't do one thing except make music for us o enjoy.
The don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corn cribs,they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.
That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."-Harper Lee,To kill a Mockingbird
